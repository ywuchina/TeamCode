% TESTFITLINE - demonstrates RANSAC line fitting
%
% Usage: testfit2Dline(outliers, sigma, t, feedback)
%
% Arguments:
%               outliers - Fraction specifying how many points are to be
%                          outliers.
%               sigma    - Standard deviation of inlying points from the
%                          true line.
%               t        - Distance threshold to be used by the RANSAC
%                          algorithm for deciding whether a point is an
%                          inlier. 
%               feedback - Optional flag 0 or 1 to turn on RANSAC feedback
%                          information.
%
%  Try using:  testfit2Dline(0.3, 0.05, 0.05)
