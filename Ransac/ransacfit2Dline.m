% RANSACFITLINE - fits line to 2D array of points using RANSAC
%
% Usage  [L, inliers] = ransacfitline(XYZ, t, feedback)
%
% This function uses the RANSAC algorithm to robustly fit a line
% to a set of 3D data points.
%
% Arguments:
%          XYZ - 3xNpts array of xyz coordinates to fit line to.
%          t   - The distance threshold between data point and the line
%                used to decide whether a point is an inlier or not.
%          feedback - Optional flag 0 or 1 to turn on RANSAC feedback
%                     information.
%
% Returns:.
%           V - Line obtained by a simple fitting on the points that
%               are considered inliers.  The line goes through the
%               calculated mean of the inlier points, and is parallel to
%               the principal eigenvector.  The line is scaled by the
%               square root of the largest eigenvalue.
%               This line is a n*2 matrix.  The first column is the
%               beginning point, the second column is the end point of the
%               line.
%           L - The two points in the data set that were found to
%               define a line having the most number of inliers.
%               The two columns of L defining the two points.
%           inliers - The indices of the points that were considered
%                     inliers to the fitted line.

% Function to calculate distances between a line and an array of points.
% The line is defined by a 2x2 matrix, L.  The two columns of L defining
% two points that are the endpoints of the line.
%
% A line can be defined with two points as:
%        lambda*p1 + (1-lambda)*p2
% Then, the distance between the line and another point (p3) is:
%        norm( lambda*p1 + (1-lambda)*p2 - p3 )
% where
%                  (p2-p1).(p2-p3)
%        lambda =  ---------------
%                  (p1-p2).(p1-p2)
%
% lambda can be found by taking the derivative of:
%      (lambda*p1 + (1-lambda)*p2 - p3)*(lambda*p1 + (1-lambda)*p2 - p3)
% with respect to lambda and setting it equal to zero
