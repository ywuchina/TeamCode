% FITPLANE - solves coefficients of plane fitted to 3 or more points
%
% Usage:   B = fitplane(XYZ)
%
% Where:   XYZ - 3xNpts array of xyz coordinates to fit plane to.   
%                If Npts is greater than 3 a least squares solution 
%                is generated.
%
% Returns: B   - 4x1 array of plane coefficients in the form
%                b(1)*X + b(2)*Y +b(3)*Z + b(4) = 0
%                The magnitude of B is 1.
